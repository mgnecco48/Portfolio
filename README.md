# Martín Gnecco — Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, built to present my background, projects, and current focus as I transition into Data Science.

The site is intentionally simple and content-focused, aiming to communicate who I am professionally rather than functioning as a technical showcase.

## About

I am a Data Science student at Kristiania University, currently transitioning from a decade-long career in professional kitchens.

Before moving into Data Science, I worked as a chef and kitchen leader in high-pressure, Michelin-starred environments across Mexico, Sweden, and Norway. That background strongly shapes how I approach my work today: I value structure, clarity, consistency, and processes that can be executed and improved over time.

This portfolio reflects that mindset. Projects are selected and presented as learning tools, focused on building strong foundations in Python, statistics, and data analysis, rather than on breadth or hype.

## Notes

This portfolio is a living document and will evolve as I progress through my studies and gain more experience.
The focus remains on learning, fundamentals, and producing work that is easy to understand and reason about.
